The example.exe shows a simple implementation of the tile set in Godot

The projects contain's the Godot file tiles.tres, this should be used with the grid node, preferable with 1x,1y,1z setting
And scaling on the y axis set to 1.5. To recreate the example add fog and appropiate lighting.

Each wall can be found individually: wall1 - wall4
And lastly, as one object at walls

If used in Godot, I would recommend importing each wall seperately.
